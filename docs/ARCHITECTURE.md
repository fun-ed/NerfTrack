# NerfTrack architecture

NerfTrack is a local-first Tauri 2 application. React renders typed projections and invokes
commands; discovery, parsing, collection, persistence, account isolation, pricing, and
estimation run in Rust. The only routine network request is the public models.dev pricing
catalog refresh at application startup, after the window is available.

## Discovery and integration boundaries

The same discovery policy is used by refresh, retry, CLI mode, and desktop mode:

1. persisted user-selected Codex home;
2. valid `CODEX_HOME` (an accessible data root, including an explicitly supplied empty future folder);
3. ordered platform candidates;
4. an explicit missing or unsupported status.

Automatic candidates are accepted only when the directory is accessible, recursive traversal is safe, and at least one readable `.jsonl` file contains a plausible Codex record. Empty candidates are skipped. A manually selected empty directory is retained as a future data location and is reported as waiting for data. On macOS, known desktop-app roots precede `~/.codex`; on Windows, per-user desktop roots precede the CLI root. When multiple candidates are valid, the first candidate in that documented order wins.

The selected home determines the integration mode. A recognized desktop-app root is Desktop Mode and does not require a CLI executable or App Server. A CLI root is CLI Mode only when a valid Codex executable is also available; a GUI executable cannot relabel a CLI-only home as Desktop Mode. The CLI App Server module is retained as a tested protocol/backoff primitive, but it is not instantiated by the refresh lifecycle in this release. The status surface reports it as unavailable rather than ready.

`discovery.rs` validates executable permissions and names, Windows `PATHEXT`, dynamic PATH entries, macOS app bundles, and guarded compatibility fallback paths. Native pickers accept no JavaScript path and return only redacted status. Folder and executable selections are stored in the local settings table and can be cleared from Setup.

## Collection and parsing

Each supported harness uses the same collector, parser, storage, and estimator pipeline. The collector enters only adapter-specific session roots, tracks canonical directories, skips recursive links, preserves byte-offset/parser-state checkpoints, and reports unreadable files or partial scans as diagnostics and failed refresh status. Spaces, Unicode, parentheses, and platform path separators are handled through `Path` APIs. Claude profiles are discovered below `~/.claude-profiles`; other harnesses use their documented local session roots. Arbitrary JSONL below a configuration root is never imported.

`parser.rs` reads newline-terminated JSONL records, tolerates a partial final line, converts cumulative per-turn token updates into deltas, extracts weekly quota observations, and tracks `thread_settings_applied` service-tier records in chronological per-rollout/session state. Only `priority` and `fast` are explicit Fast evidence; `default` is Standard and missing/unrecognized tiers remain Unknown. It emits fingerprints and normalized model/speed data rather than raw content. No timing, TPS, current config, provider, or authentication heuristic participates in speed classification.

Startup opens and migrates the SQLite schema without deleting historical derived data. A
named Rust background worker refreshes pricing and compares the current pricing digest,
reconstruction/algorithm versions, and installed-bundle marker with the last completed state.
When those markers are unchanged, the existing graph is kept and the later checkpointed
reconciliation imports only new Codex log data. When a marker changes, the worker reparses all
discoverable source JSONL rollouts, corrects explicitly evidenced historical speed fields,
reprices historical events, and rebuilds the graphs. The source scan and every SQLite mutation
needed for a full correction are committed transactionally; failed scans or rebuilds preserve
the previous graph. Status commands never wait for that background work; the UI reports
`Updating local data` while it is in progress. Later refreshes schedule one background
reconciliation at a time, so a large JSONL tree cannot freeze the application window.

## Persistence and continuity

`storage.rs` owns the SQLite schema, WAL, foreign keys, owner-restricted files, migrations, weekly-window rebuilding, measurements, estimates, settings, diagnostics, and DTO query projections. The production database is `nerftrack.db` under the platform-native per-user application-data directory, independent of the process working directory.

The database stores accounts, source checkpoints, parsed usage events, normalized profile, harness,
provider, cache-write and reported-cost fields, normalized `speed_mode`,
`speed_source`, and `fast_multiplier` evidence, quota snapshots, weekly windows, measurements,
estimates, annotations, settings, diagnostics, and app-run boundaries. It does not store prompts,
raw account identifiers, or raw JSONL lines. `estimator.rs` keeps invalid intervals pending or
rejected rather than fabricating zero values.

## Pricing refresh and historical repricing

`pricing.rs` fetches and validates models.dev's public JSON catalog with a bounded timeout and
payload size, using ETags when available. NerfTrack selects token-priced entries by direct
provider and model ID, stores the last valid payload and digest locally, and falls back to the
embedded OpenAI catalog if the network is unavailable. Manual overrides are checked first.

When the catalog digest, estimator algorithm/reconstruction version, or installed-bundle marker
changes, `storage.rs` updates the effective rates and explicit Fast multiplier on every stored
usage event and rebuilds all dependent measurements, quotes, epochs, and chart projections in
the startup background worker. An unchanged state skips that historical work. The ordinary token
API cost is multiplied by the persisted Fast multiplier before estimator pairing; the multiplier
is never reduced for Fast-mode wall-clock speed. This keeps historical graphs and calculations
aligned with current pricing and explicit rollout evidence while retaining the source and
effective rates used for audit.
